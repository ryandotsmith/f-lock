# f-lock

Much like a wild river, internet services will fail in catastrophic ways
during unexpected times. Rivers like the Mississippi employ a variaty of methods
to protect against catastrophy --one of these methods involves building locks
to quickly redirect the flow of water to another channel. F-lock is a locking
mechannism to quickly shut off flow into a failed service and redirect the flow
into a standby service.
